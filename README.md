## Description
This repository contains annotations in [JAMS](github.com/marl/jams/) format [1,2] for the [UrbanSound8k dataset](https://serv.cusp.nyu.edu/projects/urbansounddataset/index.html) [3]. It also contains the extended JAMS files returned by the [MUDA audio data augmentation library](https://github.com/bmcfee/muda) [4], which contain the deformation parameters utilized to generate the augmented UrbanSound8K training set used in [5].
